# My-Menu-Plus-Project

My project is called My Menu Plus and takes inspiration from the sudden appearance of contact-less ordering systems found in many restaurants. My project will be for me to create a tool that creates digital menu to provide contact-less ordering and payment options for restaurants, however unlike many currently existing systems will provide a recommendation engine to take full advantage of the new information-rich environment.

The project is written in ASP.net with a MySQL database. Controllers are used to populate pre created views with razor which are then cached to improve load times.

## Content Managment System
The project uses a custom content management system allowing users to create digital menus without a single line of code.

## Recommendation Script
A client side recommendation script is used to provide dynamic recommendation based on what is present in the users basket at run time.
